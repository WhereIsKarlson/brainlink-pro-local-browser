A browser that doesn't steal data! Why is that? The whole thing runs locally on your machine! It utilizes DuckDuckGo and Llama 3 AI to give results for almost anything you can think of! I’m new to Python, so I’m definitely not the best. Honestly, I had to get ChatGPT to help with some of the code. Thanks a ton for checking this out! This is a Python program, so, naturally, you’ll need to install a few things first. I’m on Windows 11, so I can only give instructions for that platform (if you’re on Linux or macOS, you’re on your own, sorry). First, open PowerShell and type git clone git clone https://github.com/WhereIsKarlson/brainlink-local-browser.git, then press Enter. Once that’s done, type cd brainlink-local-browser to move into the folder. Next, make sure you have Python 3.13 installed, then run "python -m pip install --upgrade pip" followed by "pip install tkinter customtkinter ddgs ollama", then type "pip install pywebview". (If you see something about duckduckgo_search, don’t worry — ddgs is just the newer name!) After that, download Ollama from https://ollama.com/download , install it, and then in PowerShell run "ollama pull llama3" to get the Llama 3 AI model BrainLink uses. Once everything’s ready, just type python BrainLink_Pro.py to launch it! You’ll see the window pop up, and from there you can search or type in a full URL, and it’ll handle it all right on your local machine — no data stealing, no nonsense.
